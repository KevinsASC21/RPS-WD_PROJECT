<li>ADVISORY: Due to project requirements, players must start with at least 5 of each weapon (15 total). The large number of weapons combined with RND makes it possible for a game to last over 100+ rounds. My hands are tied here so in times where gameplay becomes stagnant I suggest spam clicking.</li> 
<li>Each player begins with 5 of each weapon. </li>
<li>In order to play a weapon, simply input the corresponding word for a weapon (ex. 'rock' for rock), all other invaild inputs will be rejected. </li>
<li>The computer will choose its weapon at random. Your loss wasn't hardcoded in, you're just unlucky </li>
<li>Neither player may choose a weapon if it has exhausted its supply. </li>
<li>If a weapon is tied more than 3 times in a row, that weapon “breaks” and is removed
from the game. </li>
<li>After each player plays a weapon, the system will show them on screen and flash a message
indicating who won. Then it will update the log. There will be an indication on screen if a
weapon breaks. </li>
<li>The user will start each round simply by choosing a weapon.
When the game ends, show a message indicating the winner. Afterwards, the user can only
  continue by resetting the game. </li>
